# RandomMatrixExponentiation
Visualizations of exponentiated symmetric random matrices. We can compare numerically derived densities to known analytic results. Can also visualize the process of matrix exponentiation as a mapping from the space of symmetric matrices to the SPD manifold (a cone in d=2)
